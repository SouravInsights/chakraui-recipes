# chakraui-recipes

A tiny collection of ready to use components built out of **Chakra UI** being extracted from my daily work. The intent is to show you various use cases and examples of

I'm using Typescript here to make the components type safe but I'm still new to **Typescript** hence expect some minor hacky implementaion.
